 * Specifying XTRACT_LINEAR_SUBBANDS will extract argv[1] equal sized subbands between the start bin and N
 *
 *
 * It is assumed that a sensible function will be given in argv[0], and for this function argv will always be NULL. Sensible values for argv[0] are XTRACT_MEAN and XTRACT_SUM, although something like XTRACT_IRREGULARITY_K might yield interesting results.
