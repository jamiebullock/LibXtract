 *
 * \param *data an array of doubles
 * \param N the number of elements in the array pointed by *data
 * \param feature an integer representing the feature to be applied to each subframe in data. This will be a value as given in the enumeration xtract_features_ (libxtract.h)
 * \param *argv a pointer to the argument vector to be passed to the feature extraction function as determined by feature
 * \param *result a pointer to the 'packed' results of the feature calculation. This may be passed in as *data to xtract_features_from_subframes() to calculate further features on the subframes, or xtract_difference_vector(), to get the difference between the subframes.
 *
 *
 * It is important to ensure that any _init_*() functions that are called in preparation for functions that are called on subframes are given the subframe size as 'N', and not the frame size. i.e. if xtract_features_from_subframes() is called with N=64, and feature=XTRACT_SPECTRUM, then xtract_init_fft() should be called with N=32.
